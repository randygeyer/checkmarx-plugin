/**
 * File zipper with filter.
 * <p>
 * This class implements a file zipper with filter. Zipper will traverse a
 * specified base directory and archive all files passing the specified filter
 * test. The filter string is a comma separated list of include and exclude
 * patterns.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Pattern Syntax: (taken from DirectoryScanner documentation)
 * <p>
 * A given directory is recursively scanned for all files and directories. Each
 * file/directory is matched against a set of selectors, including special
 * support for matching against filenames with include and and exclude patterns.
 * Only files/directories which match at least one pattern of the include
 * pattern list, and don't match any pattern of the exclude pattern list will be
 * placed in the list of files/directories found.
 * <p>
 * When no list of include patterns is supplied, "**" will be used, which means
 * that everything will be matched. When no list of exclude patterns is
 * supplied, an empty list is used, such that nothing will be excluded. When no
 * selectors are supplied, none are applied.
 * <p>
 * The filename pattern matching is done as follows: The name to be matched is
 * split up in path segments. A path segment is the name of a directory or file,
 * which is bounded by <code>File.separator</code> ('/' under UNIX, '\' under
 * Windows). For example, "abc/def/ghi/xyz.java" is split up in the segments
 * "abc", "def","ghi" and "xyz.java". The same is done for the pattern against
 * which should be matched.
 * <p>
 * The segments of the name and the pattern are then matched against each other.
 * When '**' is used for a path segment in the pattern, it matches zero or more
 * path segments of the name.
 * <p>
 * There is a special case regarding the use of <code>File.separator</code>s at
 * the beginning of the pattern and the string to match:<br>
 * When a pattern starts with a <code>File.separator</code>, the string to match
 * must also start with a <code>File.separator</code>. When a pattern does not
 * start with a <code>File.separator</code>, the string to match may not start
 * with a <code>File.separator</code>. When one of these rules is not obeyed,
 * the string will not match.
 * <p>
 * When a name path segment is matched against a pattern path segment, the
 * following special characters can be used:<br>
 * '*' matches zero or more characters<br>
 * '?' matches one character.
 * <p>
 * Examples:
 * <p>
 * "**\*.class" matches all .class files/dirs in a directory tree.
 * <p>
 * "test\a??.java" matches all files/dirs which start with an 'a', then two more
 * characters and then ".java", in a directory called test.
 * <p>
 * "**" matches everything in a directory tree.
 * <p>
 * "**\test\**\XYZ*" matches all files/dirs which start with "XYZ" and where
 * there is a parent directory called test (e.g. "abc\test\def\ghi\XYZ123").
 * <p>
 * Case sensitivity may be turned off if necessary. By default, it is turned on.
 * <p>
 * Example of usage:
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * String[] includes = { &quot;**\\*.class&quot; };
 * String[] excludes = { &quot;modules\\*\\**&quot; };
 * ds.setIncludes(includes);
 * ds.setExcludes(excludes);
 * ds.setBasedir(new File(&quot;test&quot;));
 * ds.setCaseSensitive(true);
 * ds.scan();
 *
 * System.out.println(&quot;FILES:&quot;);
 * String[] files = ds.getIncludedFiles();
 * for (int i = 0; i &lt; files.length; i++) {
 * 	System.out.println(files[i]);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * This will scan a directory called test for .class files, but excludes all
 * files in all proper subdirectories of a directory called "modules"
